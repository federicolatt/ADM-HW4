### **Algorithmic Question**
This repository contains an implementation of the “Arya Wins” algorithm, which determines if Arya can win a game given an array of integers. Both Arya and her opponent play optimally.

**Description:**<br>
- The algorithm uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum score Arya can achieve from any subarray of the given list of integers. It then compares Arya’s score to her opponent’s score to determine if Arya can win.

**Complexity:**<br>
- The time complexity is O(n^2)
