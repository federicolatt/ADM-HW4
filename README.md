Fourth homework of the "Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining" class (Sc.M. in Data Science).

It consists of four main sections:

1. **Recommendation System with Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**  
   - Build a recommendation system using LSH to identify users with similar preferences based on the MovieLens dataset.
     
   - Implement MinHash and LSH from scratch for efficient clustering of user preferences.
     
   - Generate personalized movie recommendations for users.

2. **Clustering Movies**  
   - Engineer features from the MovieLens dataset to represent movies effectively.
     
   - Apply clustering algorithms (K-means, K-means++, and one suggested by an AI tool) to group movies.
     
   - Evaluate clustering quality using various metrics and determine the best algorithm for the task.

3. **Bonus Question: Clustering Visualization**
   
   - Visualize the progression of clusters during K-means iterations using selected features or principal components.

5. **Algorithmic Question**
   - This repository contains an implementation of the “Arya Wins” algorithm, which determines if Arya can win a game given an array of integers. Both Arya and her opponent play optimally.

   - Description: The algorithm uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum score Arya can achieve from any subarray of the given list of integers. It then compares Arya’s score to her opponent’s score to determine if Arya can win.

   - Complexity: The time complexity is O(n^2)
